# MBPP-Algo
Implementation of Multi-Bug-Path Planning Algorithm in Python

Here, I'm sharing my new Algorithm for Path Planning in Known Environments which I termed as 'Multi-Bug Path Planning' (MBPP) for generation of optimal path. MBPP is a Planning and Re-planning algorithm and can be able to find several alternate paths apart from optimal paths such that if one path fails, the robot or the game algo can consider other possible paths. MBPP generates multiple bugs when it encounters obstacles during it's path's travel.
